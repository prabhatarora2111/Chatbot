Animals are multicellular, eukaryotic organisms in the biological kingdom Animalia. With few exceptions, animals consume organic material, breathe oxygen, have myocytes and are able to move, can reproduce sexually, and grow from a hollow sphere of cells, the blastula, during embryonic development. Animals form a clade, meaning they arose from a single common ancestor.

Over 1.5 million living animal species have been described—of which around 1.05 million are insects, over 85,000 are molluscs, and around 65,000 are vertebrates. It has been estimated there are as many as 7.77 million animal species on Earth. Animal body lengths range from 8.5 μm (0.00033 in) to 33.6 m (110 ft). They have complex ecologies and interactions with each other and their environments, forming intricate food webs. The scientific study of animals is known as zoology, and the study of animal behaviors is known as ethology.

Most living animal species belong to the infrakingdom Bilateria, a highly proliferative clade whose members have a bilaterally symmetric body plan. Extant bilaterians include the basal group Xenacoelomorpha, but the vast majority belong to two large superphyla: the protostomes, which includes organisms such as the arthropods, molluscs, flatworms, annelids and nematodes; and the deuterostomes, which include the echinoderms, hemichordates and chordates, the latter of which contains the vertebrates.

Animals first appear in the fossil record in the late Cryogenian period, and diversified in the subsequent Ediacaran. Earlier evidence of animals is still controversial; the sponge-like organism Otavia has been dated all the way back to the Tonian period, but its identity as an animal is heavily contested.[4] Nearly all modern animal phyla became clearly established in the fossil record as marine species during the Cambrian explosion, which began around 539 million years ago (Mya), and most classes during the Ordovician radiation 485.4 Mya. 6,331 groups of genes common to all living animals have been identified; these may have arisen from a single common ancestor that lived about 650 Mya during the Cryogenian period.

Historically, Aristotle divided animals into those with blood and those without. Carl Linnaeus created the first hierarchical biological classification for animals in 1758 with his Systema Naturae, which Jean-Baptiste Lamarck expanded into 14 phyla by 1809. In 1874, Ernst Haeckel divided the animal kingdom into the multicellular Metazoa (now synonymous with Animalia) and the Protozoa, single-celled organisms no longer considered animals. In modern times, the biological classification of animals relies on advanced techniques, such as molecular phylogenetics, which are effective at demonstrating the evolutionary relationships between taxa.

Humans make use of many other animal species for food (including meat, eggs and dairies), for materials (such as leather, fur and wool), as pets and as working animals for transportation, and services. Dogs, the first domesticated animal, have been used in hunting, in security and in warfare, as have horses, pigeons and birds of prey, while other terrestrial and aquatic animals are hunted for sports, trophies or profits. Non-human animals are also an important cultural element of human evolution, having appeared in cave arts and totems since the earliest times, and are frequently featured in mythology, religion, arts, literature, heraldry, politics and sports.

Etymology
The word animal comes from the Latin noun animal of the same meaning, which is itself derived from Latin animalis 'having breath or soul'.[5] The biological definition includes all members of the kingdom Animalia.[6] In colloquial usage, the term animal is often used to refer only to nonhuman animals.[7][8][9][10] The term metazoa is derived from Ancient Greek μετα (meta) 'after' (in biology, the prefix meta- stands for 'later') and ζῷᾰ (zōia) 'animals', plural of ζῷον zōion 'animal'.[11][12]

Characteristics

Animals are unique in having the ball of cells of the early embryo (1) develop into a hollow ball or blastula (2).
Animals have several characteristics that set them apart from other living things. Animals are eukaryotic and multicellular.[13] Unlike plants and algae, which produce their own nutrients,[14] animals are heterotrophic,[15][16] feeding on organic material and digesting it internally.[17] With very few exceptions, animals respire aerobically.[a][19] All animals are motile[20] (able to spontaneously move their bodies) during at least part of their life cycle, but some animals, such as sponges, corals, mussels, and barnacles, later become sessile. The blastula is a stage in embryonic development that is unique to animals, allowing cells to be differentiated into specialised tissues and organs.[21]

Structure
All animals are composed of cells, surrounded by a characteristic extracellular matrix composed of collagen and elastic glycoproteins.[22] During development, the animal extracellular matrix forms a relatively flexible framework upon which cells can move about and be reorganised, making the formation of complex structures possible. This may be calcified, forming structures such as shells, bones, and spicules.[23] In contrast, the cells of other multicellular organisms (primarily algae, plants, and fungi) are held in place by cell walls, and so develop by progressive growth.[24] Animal cells uniquely possess the cell junctions called tight junctions, gap junctions, and desmosomes.[25]

With few exceptions—in particular, the sponges and placozoans—animal bodies are differentiated into tissues.[26] These include muscles, which enable locomotion, and nerve tissues, which transmit signals and coordinate the body. Typically, there is also an internal digestive chamber with either one opening (in Ctenophora, Cnidaria, and flatworms) or two openings (in most bilaterians).[27]

Reproduction and development
See also: Sexual reproduction § Animals, and Asexual reproduction § Examples in animals

Sexual reproduction is nearly universal in animals, such as these dragonflies.
Nearly all animals make use of some form of sexual reproduction.[28] They produce haploid gametes by meiosis; the smaller, motile gametes are spermatozoa and the larger, non-motile gametes are ova.[29] These fuse to form zygotes,[30] which develop via mitosis into a hollow sphere, called a blastula. In sponges, blastula larvae swim to a new location, attach to the seabed, and develop into a new sponge.[31] In most other groups, the blastula undergoes more complicated rearrangement.[32] It first invaginates to form a gastrula with a digestive chamber and two separate germ layers, an external ectoderm and an internal endoderm.[33] In most cases, a third germ layer, the mesoderm, also develops between them.[34] These germ layers then differentiate to form tissues and organs.[35]

Repeated instances of mating with a close relative during sexual reproduction generally leads to inbreeding depression within a population due to the increased prevalence of harmful recessive traits.[36][37] Animals have evolved numerous mechanisms for avoiding close inbreeding.[38]

Some animals are capable of asexual reproduction, which often results in a genetic clone of the parent. This may take place through fragmentation; budding, such as in Hydra and other cnidarians; or parthenogenesis, where fertile eggs are produced without mating, such as in aphids.[39][40]

Ecology

Predators, such as this ultramarine flycatcher (Ficedula superciliaris), feed on other animals.
Animals are categorised into ecological groups depending on their trophic levels and how they consume organic material. Such groupings include carnivores (further divided into subcategories such as piscivores, insectivores, ovivores, etc.), herbivores (subcategorized into folivores, graminivores, frugivores, granivores, nectarivores, algivores, etc.), omnivores, fungivores, scavengers/detritivores,[41] and parasites.[42] Interactions between animals of each biome form complex food webs within that ecosystem. In carnivorous or omnivorous species, predation is a consumer–resource interaction where the predator feeds on another organism, its prey,[43] who often evolves anti-predator adaptations to avoid being fed upon. Selective pressures imposed on one another lead to an evolutionary arms race between predator and prey, resulting in various antagonistic/competitive coevolutions.[44][45] Almost all multicellular predators are animals.[46] Some consumers use multiple methods; for example, in parasitoid wasps, the larvae feed on the hosts' living tissues, killing them in the process,[47] but the adults primarily consume nectar from flowers.[48] Other animals may have very specific feeding behaviours, such as hawksbill sea turtles which mainly eat sponges.[49]


Hydrothermal vent mussels and shrimps
Most animals rely on biomass and bioenergy produced by plants and phytoplanktons (collectively called producers) through photosynthesis. Herbivores, as primary consumers, eat the plant material directly to digest and absorb the nutrients, while carnivores and other animals on higher trophic levels indirectly acquire the nutrients by eating the herbivores or other animals that have eaten the herbivores. Animals oxidize carbohydrates, lipids, proteins and other biomolecules, which allows the animal to grow and to sustain basal metabolism and fuel other biological processes such as locomotion.[50][51][52] Some benthic animals living close to hydrothermal vents and cold seeps on the dark sea floor consume organic matter produced through chemosynthesis (via oxidizing inorganic compounds such as hydrogen sulfide) by archaea and bacteria.[53]

Animals evolved in the sea. Lineages of arthropods colonised land around the same time as land plants, probably between 510 and 471 million years ago during the Late Cambrian or Early Ordovician.[54] Vertebrates such as the lobe-finned fish Tiktaalik started to move on to land in the late Devonian, about 375 million years ago.[55][56] Animals occupy virtually all of earth's habitats and microhabitats, with faunas adapted to salt water, hydrothermal vents, fresh water, hot springs, swamps, forests, pastures, deserts, air, and the interiors of other organisms.[57] Animals are however not particularly heat tolerant; very few of them can survive at constant temperatures above 50 °C (122 °F)[58] or in the most extreme cold deserts of continental Antarctica.[59]

The blue whale is the largest animal that has ever lived.
The blue whale (Balaenoptera musculus) is the largest animal that has ever lived, weighing up to 190 tonnes and measuring up to 33.6 metres (110 ft) long.[60][61][62] The largest extant terrestrial animal is the African bush elephant (Loxodonta africana), weighing up to 12.25 tonnes[60] and measuring up to 10.67 metres (35.0 ft) long.[60] The largest terrestrial animals that ever lived were titanosaur sauropod dinosaurs such as Argentinosaurus, which may have weighed as much as 73 tonnes, and Supersaurus which may have reached 39 meters.[63][64] Several animals are microscopic; some Myxozoa (obligate parasites within the Cnidaria) never grow larger than 20 µm,[65] and one of the smallest species (Myxobolus shekel) is no more than 8.5 µm when fully grown.[66]

Numbers and habitats of major phyla
The following table lists estimated numbers of described extant species for the major animal phyla,[67] along with their principal habitats (terrestrial, fresh water,[68] and marine),[69] and free-living or parasitic ways of life.[70] Species estimates shown here are based on numbers described scientifically; much larger estimates have been calculated based on various means of prediction, and these can vary wildly. For instance, around 25,000–27,000 species of nematodes have been described, while published estimates of the total number of nematode species include 10,000–20,000; 500,000; 10 million; and 100 million.[71] Using patterns within the taxonomic hierarchy, the total number of animal species—including those not yet described—was calculated to be about 7.77 million in 2011.[72][73][b]

Evolutionary origin
Further information: Urmetazoan
Evidence of animals is found as long ago as the Cryogenian period. 24-Isopropylcholestane (24-ipc) has been found in rocks from roughly 650 million years ago; it is only produced by sponges and pelagophyte algae. Its likely origin is from sponges based on molecular clock estimates for the origin of 24-ipc production in both groups. Analyses of pelagophyte algae consistently recover a Phanerozoic origin, while analyses of sponges recover a Neoproterozoic origin, consistent with the appearance of 24-ipc in the fossil record.[88][89]

The first body fossils of animals appear in the Ediacaran, represented by forms such as Charnia and Spriggina. It had long been doubted whether these fossils truly represented animals,[90][91][92] but the discovery of the animal lipid cholesterol in fossils of Dickinsonia establishes their nature.[93] Animals are thought to have originated under low-oxygen conditions, suggesting that they were capable of living entirely by anaerobic respiration, but as they became specialized for aerobic metabolism they became fully dependent on oxygen in their environments.[94]

Many animal phyla first appear in the fossil record during the Cambrian explosion, starting about 539 million years ago, in beds such as the Burgess shale.[95] Extant phyla in these rocks include molluscs, brachiopods, onychophorans, tardigrades, arthropods, echinoderms and hemichordates, along with numerous now-extinct forms such as the predatory Anomalocaris. The apparent suddenness of the event may however be an artifact of the fossil record, rather than showing that all these animals appeared simultaneously.[96][97][98][99] That view is supported by the discovery of Auroralumina attenboroughii, the earliest known Ediacaran crown-group cnidarian (557–562 mya, some 20 million years before the Cambrian explosion) from Charnwood Forest, England. It is thought to be one of the earliest predators, catching small prey with its nematocysts as modern cnidarians do.[100]

Some palaeontologists have suggested that animals appeared much earlier than the Cambrian explosion, possibly as early as 1 billion years ago.[101] Early fossils that might represent animals appear for example in the 665-million-year-old rocks of the Trezona Formation of South Australia. These fossils are interpreted as most probably being early sponges.[102] Trace fossils such as tracks and burrows found in the Tonian period (from 1 gya) may indicate the presence of triploblastic worm-like animals, roughly as large (about 5 mm wide) and complex as earthworms.[103] However, similar tracks are produced by the giant single-celled protist Gromia sphaerica, so the Tonian trace fossils may not indicate early animal evolution.[104][105] Around the same time, the layered mats of microorganisms called stromatolites decreased in diversity, perhaps due to grazing by newly evolved animals.[106] Objects such as sediment-filled tubes that resemble trace fossils of the burrows of wormlike animals have been found in 1.2 gya rocks in North America, in 1.5 gya rocks in Australia and North America, and in 1.7 gya rocks in Australia. Their interpretation as having an animal origin is disputed, as they might be water-escape or other structures.[107][108]

Dickinsonia costata from the Ediacaran biota (c. 635–542 mya) is one of the earliest animal species known.[93]

Phylogeny
Further information: Lists of animals
External phylogeny
Animals are monophyletic, meaning they are derived from a common ancestor. Animals are the sister group to the choanoflagellates, with which they form the Choanozoa.[109] The dates on the phylogenetic tree indicate approximately how many millions of years ago (mya) the lineages split.[110][111][112][113][114]

Ros-Rocher and colleagues (2021) trace the origins of animals to unicellular ancestors, providing the external phylogeny shown in the cladogram. Uncertainty of relationships is indicated with dashed lines.[115]

Internal phylogeny
The most basal animals, the Porifera, Ctenophora, Cnidaria, and Placozoa, have body plans that lack bilateral symmetry. Their relationships are still disputed; the sister group to all other animals could be the Porifera or the Ctenophora,[116] both of which lack hox genes, which are important for body plan development.[117]

Hox genes are found in the Placozoa[118][119], Cnidaria[120], and Bilateria.[121][122] 6,331 groups of genes common to all living animals have been identified; these may have arisen from a single common ancestor that lived 650 million years ago in the Precambrian. 25 of these are novel core gene groups, found only in animals; of those, 8 are for essential components of the Wnt and TGF-beta signalling pathways which may have enabled animals to become multicellular by providing a pattern for the body's system of axes (in three dimensions), and another 7 are for transcription factors including homeodomain proteins involved in the control of development.[123][124]

Giribet and Edgecombe (2020) provide what they consider to be a consensus internal phylogeny of the animals, embodying uncertainty about the structure at the base of the tree (dashed lines).[125]

An alternative phylogeny, from Kapli and colleagues (2021), proposes a clade Xenambulacraria for the Xenacoelamorpha + Ambulacraria; this is either within Deuterostomia, as sister to Chordata, or the Deuterostomia are recovered as paraphyletic, and Xenambulacraria is sister to the proposed clade Centroneuralia, consisting of Chordata + Protostomia.[126]

Non-bilateria

Non-bilaterians include sponges (centre) and corals (background).
Several animal phyla lack bilateral symmetry. These are the Porifera (sea sponges), Placozoa, Cnidaria (which includes jellyfish, sea anemones, and corals), and Ctenophora (comb jellies).

Sponges are physically very distinct from other animals, and were long thought to have diverged first, representing the oldest animal phylum and forming a sister clade to all other animals.[127] Despite their morphological dissimilarity with all other animals, genetic evidence suggests sponges may be more closely related to other animals than the comb jellies are.[128][129] Sponges lack the complex organization found in most other animal phyla;[130] their cells are differentiated, but in most cases not organised into distinct tissues, unlike all other animals.[131] They typically feed by drawing in water through pores, filtering out food and nutrients.[132]

The comb jellies and Cnidaria are radially symmetric and have digestive chambers with a single opening, which serves as both mouth and anus.[133] Animals in both phyla have distinct tissues, but these are not organised into discrete organs.[134] They are diploblastic, having only two main germ layers, ectoderm and endoderm.[135]

The tiny placozoans have no permanent digestive chamber and no symmetry; they superficially resemble amoebae.[136][137] Their phylogeny is poorly defined, and under active research.[128][138]

Bilateria
Main articles: Bilateria and Symmetry (biology) § Bilateral symmetry

Idealised bilaterian body plan.[d] With an elongated body and a direction of movement the animal has head and tail ends. Sense organs and mouth form the basis of the head. Opposed circular and longitudinal muscles enable peristaltic motion.
The remaining animals, the great majority—comprising some 29 phyla and over a million species—form a clade, the Bilateria, which have a bilaterally symmetric body plan. The Bilateria are triploblastic, with three well-developed germ layers, and their tissues form distinct organs. The digestive chamber has two openings, a mouth and an anus, and there is an internal body cavity, a coelom or pseudocoelom. These animals have a head end (anterior) and a tail end (posterior), a back (dorsal) surface and a belly (ventral) surface, and a left and a right side.[139][140]

Having a front end means that this part of the body encounters stimuli, such as food, favouring cephalisation, the development of a head with sense organs and a mouth. Many bilaterians have a combination of circular muscles that constrict the body, making it longer, and an opposing set of longitudinal muscles, that shorten the body;[140] these enable soft-bodied animals with a hydrostatic skeleton to move by peristalsis.[141] They also have a gut that extends through the basically cylindrical body from mouth to anus. Many bilaterian phyla have primary larvae which swim with cilia and have an apical organ containing sensory cells. However, over evolutionary time, descendant spaces have evolved which have lost one or more of each of these characteristics. For example, adult echinoderms are radially symmetric (unlike their larvae), while some parasitic worms have extremely simplified body structures.[139][140]

Genetic studies have considerably changed zoologists' understanding of the relationships within the Bilateria. Most appear to belong to two major lineages, the protostomes and the deuterostomes.[142] It is often suggested that the basalmost bilaterians are the Xenacoelomorpha, with all other bilaterians belonging to the subclade Nephrozoa[143][144][145] However, this suggestion has been contested, with other studies finding that xenacoelomorphs are more closely related to Ambulacraria than to other bilaterians.[126]

Protostomes and deuterostomes
Further information: Embryological origins of the mouth and anus
Main articles: Protostome and Deuterostome

The bilaterian gut develops in two ways. In many protostomes, the blastopore develops into the mouth, while in deuterostomes it becomes the anus.
Protostomes and deuterostomes differ in several ways. Early in development, deuterostome embryos undergo radial cleavage during cell division, while many protostomes (the Spiralia) undergo spiral cleavage.[146] Animals from both groups possess a complete digestive tract, but in protostomes the first opening of the embryonic gut develops into the mouth, and the anus forms secondarily. In deuterostomes, the anus forms first while the mouth develops secondarily.[147][148] Most protostomes have schizocoelous development, where cells simply fill in the interior of the gastrula to form the mesoderm. In deuterostomes, the mesoderm forms by enterocoelic pouching, through invagination of the endoderm.[149]

The main deuterostome phyla are the Echinodermata and the Chordata.[150] Echinoderms are exclusively marine and include starfish, sea urchins, and sea cucumbers.[151] The chordates are dominated by the vertebrates (animals with backbones),[152] which consist of fishes, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals.[153] The deuterostomes also include the Hemichordata (acorn worms).[154][155]

Ecdysozoa
Main article: Ecdysozoa

Ecdysis: a dragonfly has emerged from its dry exuviae and is expanding its wings. Like other arthropods, its body is divided into segments.
The Ecdysozoa are protostomes, named after their shared trait of ecdysis, growth by moulting.[156] They include the largest animal phylum, the Arthropoda, which contains insects, spiders, crabs, and their kin. All of these have a body divided into repeating segments, typically with paired appendages. Two smaller phyla, the Onychophora and Tardigrada, are close relatives of the arthropods and share these traits. The ecdysozoans also include the Nematoda or roundworms, perhaps the second largest animal phylum. Roundworms are typically microscopic, and occur in nearly every environment where there is water;[157] some are important parasites.[158] Smaller phyla related to them are the Nematomorpha or horsehair worms, and the Kinorhyncha, Priapulida, and Loricifera. These groups have a reduced coelom, called a pseudocoelom.[159]

Spiralia
Main article: Spiralia

Spiral cleavage in a sea snail embryo
The Spiralia are a large group of protostomes that develop by spiral cleavage in the early embryo.[160] The Spiralia's phylogeny has been disputed, but it contains a large clade, the superphylum Lophotrochozoa, and smaller groups of phyla such as the Rouphozoa which includes the gastrotrichs and the flatworms. All of these are grouped as the Platytrochozoa, which has a sister group, the Gnathifera, which includes the rotifers.[161][162]

The Lophotrochozoa includes the molluscs, annelids, brachiopods, nemerteans, bryozoa and entoprocts.[161][163][164] The molluscs, the second-largest animal phylum by number of described species, includes snails, clams, and squids, while the annelids are the segmented worms, such as earthworms, lugworms, and leeches. These two groups have long been considered close relatives because they share trochophore larvae.[165][166]

History of classification
Further information: Taxonomy (biology), History of zoology through 1859, and History of zoology since 1859

Jean-Baptiste de Lamarck led the creation of a modern classification of invertebrates, breaking up Linnaeus's "Vermes" into 9 phyla by 1809.[167]
In the classical era, Aristotle divided animals,[e] based on his own observations, into those with blood (roughly, the vertebrates) and those without. The animals were then arranged on a scale from man (with blood, 2 legs, rational soul) down through the live-bearing tetrapods (with blood, 4 legs, sensitive soul) and other groups such as crustaceans (no blood, many legs, sensitive soul) down to spontaneously generating creatures like sponges (no blood, no legs, vegetable soul). Aristotle was uncertain whether sponges were animals, which in his system ought to have sensation, appetite, and locomotion, or plants, which did not: he knew that sponges could sense touch, and would contract if about to be pulled off their rocks, but that they were rooted like plants and never moved about.[168]

In 1758, Carl Linnaeus created the first hierarchical classification in his Systema Naturae.[169] In his original scheme, the animals were one of three kingdoms, divided into the classes of Vermes, Insecta, Pisces, Amphibia, Aves, and Mammalia. Since then the last four have all been subsumed into a single phylum, the Chordata, while his Insecta (which included the crustaceans and arachnids) and Vermes have been renamed or broken up. The process was begun in 1793 by Jean-Baptiste de Lamarck, who called the Vermes une espèce de chaos (a chaotic mess)[f] and split the group into three new phyla: worms, echinoderms, and polyps (which contained corals and jellyfish). By 1809, in his Philosophie Zoologique, Lamarck had created 9 phyla apart from vertebrates (where he still had 4 phyla: mammals, birds, reptiles, and fish) and molluscs, namely cirripedes, annelids, crustaceans, arachnids, insects, worms, radiates, polyps, and infusorians.[167]

In his 1817 Le Règne Animal, Georges Cuvier used comparative anatomy to group the animals into four embranchements ("branches" with different body plans, roughly corresponding to phyla), namely vertebrates, molluscs, articulated animals (arthropods and annelids), and zoophytes (radiata) (echinoderms, cnidaria and other forms).[171] This division into four was followed by the embryologist Karl Ernst von Baer in 1828, the zoologist Louis Agassiz in 1857, and the comparative anatomist Richard Owen in 1860.[172]

In 1874, Ernst Haeckel divided the animal kingdom into two subkingdoms: Metazoa (multicellular animals, with five phyla: coelenterates, echinoderms, articulates, molluscs, and vertebrates) and Protozoa (single-celled animals), including a sixth animal phylum, sponges.[173][172] The protozoa were later moved to the former kingdom Protista, leaving only the Metazoa as a synonym of Animalia.[174]

Sides of beef in a slaughterhouse
The human population exploits a large number of other animal species for food, both of domesticated livestock species in animal husbandry and, mainly at sea, by hunting wild species.[175][176] Marine fish of many species are caught commercially for food. A smaller number of species are farmed commercially.[175][177][178] Humans and their livestock make up more than 90% of the biomass of all terrestrial vertebrates, and almost as much as all insects combined.[179]

Invertebrates including cephalopods, crustaceans, and bivalve or gastropod molluscs are hunted or farmed for food.[180] Chickens, cattle, sheep, pigs, and other animals are raised as livestock for meat across the world.[176][181][182] Animal fibres such as wool are used to make textiles, while animal sinews have been used as lashings and bindings, and leather is widely used to make shoes and other items. Animals have been hunted and farmed for their fur to make items such as coats and hats.[183] Dyestuffs including carmine (cochineal),[184][185] shellac,[186][187] and kermes[188][189] have been made from the bodies of insects. Working animals including cattle and horses have been used for work and transport from the first days of agriculture.[190]

Animals such as the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster serve a major role in science as experimental models.[191][192][193][194] Animals have been used to create vaccines since their discovery in the 18th century.[195] Some medicines such as the cancer drug trabectedin are based on toxins or other molecules of animal origin.[196]


A gun dog retrieving a duck during a hunt
People have used hunting dogs to help chase down and retrieve animals,[197] and birds of prey to catch birds and mammals,[198] while tethered cormorants have been used to catch fish.[199] Poison dart frogs have been used to poison the tips of blowpipe darts.[200][201] A wide variety of animals are kept as pets, from invertebrates such as tarantulas, octopuses, and praying mantises,[202] reptiles such as snakes and chameleons,[203] and birds including canaries, parakeets, and parrots[204] all finding a place. However, the most kept pet species are mammals, namely dogs, cats, and rabbits.[205][206][207] There is a tension between the role of animals as companions to humans, and their existence as individuals with rights of their own.[208] A wide variety of terrestrial and aquatic animals are hunted for sport.[209]

Symbolic uses

Artistic vision: Still Life with Lobster and Oysters by Alexander Coosemans, c. 1660
Animals have been the subjects of art from the earliest times, both historical, as in Ancient Egypt, and prehistoric, as in the cave paintings at Lascaux. Major animal paintings include Albrecht Dürer's 1515 The Rhinoceros, and George Stubbs's c. 1762 horse portrait Whistlejacket.[210] Insects, birds and mammals play roles in literature and film,[211] such as in giant bug movies.[212][213][214]

Animals including insects[215] and mammals[216] are featured in mythology and religion. In both Japan and Europe, a butterfly was seen as the personification of a person's soul,[215][217][218] while the scarab beetle was sacred in ancient Egypt.[219] Among the mammals, cattle,[220] deer,[216] horses,[221] lions,[222] bats,[223] bears,[224] and wolves[225] are the subjects of myths and worship. The signs of the Western and Chinese zodiacs are also based on animals.[226][227]

Notes
 Henneguya zschokkei does not have mitochondrial DNA or utilize aerobic respiration.[18]
 The application of DNA barcoding to taxonomy further complicates this; a 2016 barcoding analysis estimated a total count of nearly 100,000 insect species for Canada alone, and extrapolated that the global insect fauna must be in excess of 10 million species, of which nearly 2 million are in a single fly family known as gall midges (Cecidomyiidae).[74]
 Not including parasitoids.[70]

 In statistical modeling, regression analysis is a set of statistical processes for estimating the relationships between a dependent variable (often called the 'outcome' or 'response' variable, or a 'label' in machine learning parlance) and one or more independent variables (often called 'predictors', 'covariates', 'explanatory variables' or 'features'). The most common form of regression analysis is linear regression, in which one finds the line (or a more complex linear combination) that most closely fits the data according to a specific mathematical criterion. For example, the method of ordinary least squares computes the unique line (or hyperplane) that minimizes the sum of squared differences between the true data and that line (or hyperplane). For specific mathematical reasons (see linear regression), this allows the researcher to estimate the conditional expectation (or population average value) of the dependent variable when the independent variables take on a given set of values. Less common forms of regression use slightly different procedures to estimate alternative location parameters (e.g., quantile regression or Necessary Condition Analysis[1]) or estimate the conditional expectation across a broader collection of non-linear models (e.g., nonparametric regression).

Regression analysis is primarily used for two conceptually distinct purposes. First, regression analysis is widely used for prediction and forecasting, where its use has substantial overlap with the field of machine learning. Second, in some situations regression analysis can be used to infer causal relationships between the independent and dependent variables. Importantly, regressions by themselves only reveal relationships between a dependent variable and a collection of independent variables in a fixed dataset. To use regressions for prediction or to infer causal relationships, respectively, a researcher must carefully justify why existing relationships have predictive power for a new context or why a relationship between two variables has a causal interpretation. The latter is especially important when researchers hope to estimate causal relationships using observational data.[2][3]

History
The earliest form of regression was the method of least squares, which was published by Legendre in 1805,[4] and by Gauss in 1809.[5] Legendre and Gauss both applied the method to the problem of determining, from astronomical observations, the orbits of bodies about the Sun (mostly comets, but also later the then newly discovered minor planets). Gauss published a further development of the theory of least squares in 1821,[6] including a version of the Gauss–Markov theorem.

The term "regression" was coined by Francis Galton in the 19th century to describe a biological phenomenon. The phenomenon was that the heights of descendants of tall ancestors tend to regress down towards a normal average (a phenomenon also known as regression toward the mean).[7][8] For Galton, regression had only this biological meaning,[9][10] but his work was later extended by Udny Yule and Karl Pearson to a more general statistical context.[11][12] In the work of Yule and Pearson, the joint distribution of the response and explanatory variables is assumed to be Gaussian. This assumption was weakened by R.A. Fisher in his works of 1922 and 1925.[13][14][15] Fisher assumed that the conditional distribution of the response variable is Gaussian, but the joint distribution need not be. In this respect, Fisher's assumption is closer to Gauss's formulation of 1821.

In the 1950s and 1960s, economists used electromechanical desk calculators to calculate regressions. Before 1970, it sometimes took up to 24 hours to receive the result from one regression.[16]

Regression methods continue to be an area of active research. In recent decades, new methods have been developed for robust regression, regression involving correlated responses such as time series and growth curves, regression in which the predictor (independent variable) or response variables are curves, images, graphs, or other complex data objects, regression methods accommodating various types of missing data, nonparametric regression, Bayesian methods for regression, regression in which the predictor variables are measured with error, regression with more predictor variables than observations, and causal inference with regression.

Regression model
In practice, researchers first select a model they would like to estimate and then use their chosen method (e.g., ordinary least squares) to estimate the parameters of that model. Regression models involve the following components:

The unknown parameters, often denoted as a scalar or vector 
�{\displaystyle \beta }.
The independent variables, which are observed in data and are often denoted as a vector 
�
�
{\displaystyle X_{i}} (where 
�
{\displaystyle i} denotes a row of data).
The dependent variable, which are observed in data and often denoted using the scalar 
�
�
{\displaystyle Y_{i}}.
The error terms, which are not directly observed in data and are often denoted using the scalar 
�
�
{\displaystyle e_{i}}.
In various fields of application, different terminologies are used in place of dependent and independent variables.

Most regression models propose that 
�
�
{\displaystyle Y_{i}} is a function (regression function) of 
�
�
{\displaystyle X_{i}} and 
�{\displaystyle \beta }, with 
�
�
{\displaystyle e_{i}} representing an additive error term that may stand in for un-modeled determinants of 
�
�
{\displaystyle Y_{i}} or random statistical noise:

�
�
=
�
(
�
�
,
�
)
+
�
�
{\displaystyle Y_{i}=f(X_{i},\beta )+e_{i}}
The researchers' goal is to estimate the function 
�
(
�
�
,
�
)
{\displaystyle f(X_{i},\beta )} that most closely fits the data. To carry out regression analysis, the form of the function 
�
{\displaystyle f} must be specified. Sometimes the form of this function is based on knowledge about the relationship between 
�
�
{\displaystyle Y_{i}} and 
�
�
{\displaystyle X_{i}} that does not rely on the data. If no such knowledge is available, a flexible or convenient form for 
�
{\displaystyle f} is chosen. For example, a simple univariate regression may propose 
�
(
�
�
,
�
)
=
�
0
+
�
1
�
�
{\displaystyle f(X_{i},\beta )=\beta _{0}+\beta _{1}X_{i}}, suggesting that the researcher believes 
�
�
=
�
0
+
�
1
�
�
+
�
�
{\displaystyle Y_{i}=\beta _{0}+\beta _{1}X_{i}+e_{i}} to be a reasonable approximation for the statistical process generating the data.

Once researchers determine their preferred statistical model, different forms of regression analysis provide tools to estimate the parameters 
�{\displaystyle \beta }. For example, least squares (including its most common variant, ordinary least squares) finds the value of 
�{\displaystyle \beta } that minimizes the sum of squared errors 
∑
�
(
�
�
−
�
(
�
�
,
�
)
)
2
{\displaystyle \sum _{i}(Y_{i}-f(X_{i},\beta ))^{2}}. A given regression method will ultimately provide an estimate of 
�{\displaystyle \beta }, usually denoted 
�
^{\displaystyle {\hat {\beta }}} to distinguish the estimate from the true (unknown) parameter value that generated the data. Using this estimate, the researcher can then use the fitted value 
�
�
^
=
�
(
�
�
,
�
^
)
{\displaystyle {\hat {Y_{i}}}=f(X_{i},{\hat {\beta }})} for prediction or to assess the accuracy of the model in explaining the data. Whether the researcher is intrinsically interested in the estimate 
�
^{\displaystyle {\hat {\beta }}} or the predicted value 
�
�
^{\displaystyle {\hat {Y_{i}}}} will depend on context and their goals. As described in ordinary least squares, least squares is widely used because the estimated function 
�
(
�
�
,
�
^
)
{\displaystyle f(X_{i},{\hat {\beta }})} approximates the conditional expectation 
�
(
�
�
|
�
�
)
{\displaystyle E(Y_{i}|X_{i})}.[5] However, alternative variants (e.g., least absolute deviations or quantile regression) are useful when researchers want to model other functions 
�
(
�
�
,
�
)
{\displaystyle f(X_{i},\beta )}.

It is important to note that there must be sufficient data to estimate a regression model. For example, suppose that a researcher has access to 
�
{\displaystyle N} rows of data with one dependent and two independent variables: 
(
�
�
,
�
1
�
,
�
2
�
)
{\displaystyle (Y_{i},X_{1i},X_{2i})}. Suppose further that the researcher wants to estimate a bivariate linear model via least squares: 
�
�
=
�
0
+
�
1
�
1
�
+
�
2
�
2
�
+
�
�
{\displaystyle Y_{i}=\beta _{0}+\beta _{1}X_{1i}+\beta _{2}X_{2i}+e_{i}}. If the researcher only has access to 
�
=
2
{\displaystyle N=2} data points, then they could find infinitely many combinations 
(
�
^
0
,
�
^
1
,
�
^
2
)
{\displaystyle ({\hat {\beta }}_{0},{\hat {\beta }}_{1},{\hat {\beta }}_{2})} that explain the data equally well: any combination can be chosen that satisfies 
�

�
=

�
^

�
2
�
{\displaystyle {\hat {Y}}_{i}={\hat {\beta }}_{0}+{\hat {\beta }}_{1}X_{1i}+{\hat {\beta }}_{2}X_{2i}}, all of which lead to 
∑

{\displaystyle \sum _{i}{\hat {e}}_{i}^{2}=\sum _{i}({\hat {Y}}_{i}-({\hat {\beta }}_{0}+{\hat {\beta }}_{1}X_{1i}+{\hat {\beta }}_{2}X_{2i}))^{2}=0} and are therefore valid solutions that minimize the sum of squared residuals. To understand why there are infinitely many options, note that the system of 
�
=
2
{\displaystyle N=2} equations is to be solved for 3 unknowns, which makes the system underdetermined. Alternatively, one can visualize infinitely many 3-dimensional planes that go through 
�
=
2
{\displaystyle N=2} fixed points.

More generally, to estimate a least squares model with 
�
{\displaystyle k} distinct parameters, one must have 
�
≥
�
{\displaystyle N\geq k} distinct data points. If 
�
>
�
{\displaystyle N>k}, then there does not generally exist a set of parameters that will perfectly fit the data. The quantity 
�
−
�
{\displaystyle N-k} appears often in regression analysis, and is referred to as the degrees of freedom in the model. Moreover, to estimate a least squares model, the independent variables 
(
�
1
�
,
�
2
�
,
.
.
.
,
�
�
�
)
{\displaystyle (X_{1i},X_{2i},...,X_{ki})} must be linearly independent: one must not be able to reconstruct any of the independent variables by adding and multiplying the remaining independent variables. As discussed in ordinary least squares, this condition ensures that 
�
�
�
{\displaystyle X^{T}X} is an invertible matrix and therefore that a unique solution 
�
^{\displaystyle {\hat {\beta }}} exists.

Underlying assumptions

By itself, a regression is simply a calculation using the data. In order to interpret the output of regression as a meaningful statistical quantity that measures real-world relationships, researchers often rely on a number of classical assumptions. These assumptions often include:

The sample is representative of the population at large.
The independent variables are measured with no error.
Deviations from the model have an expected value of zero, conditional on covariates: 
�
(
�
�
|
�
�
)
=
0
{\displaystyle E(e_{i}|X_{i})=0}
The variance of the residuals 
�
�
{\displaystyle e_{i}} is constant across observations (homoscedasticity).
The residuals 
�
�
{\displaystyle e_{i}} are uncorrelated with one another. Mathematically, the variance–covariance matrix of the errors is diagonal.
A handful of conditions are sufficient for the least-squares estimator to possess desirable properties: in particular, the Gauss–Markov assumptions imply that the parameter estimates will be unbiased, consistent, and efficient in the class of linear unbiased estimators. Practitioners have developed a variety of methods to maintain some or all of these desirable properties in real-world settings, because these classical assumptions are unlikely to hold exactly. For example, modeling errors-in-variables can lead to reasonable estimates independent variables are measured with errors. Heteroscedasticity-consistent standard errors allow the variance of 
�
�
{\displaystyle e_{i}} to change across values of 
�
�
{\displaystyle X_{i}}. Correlated errors that exist within subsets of the data or follow specific patterns can be handled using clustered standard errors, geographic weighted regression, or Newey–West standard errors, among other techniques. When rows of data correspond to locations in space, the choice of how to model 
�
�
{\displaystyle e_{i}} within geographic units can have important consequences.[17][18] The subfield of econometrics is largely focused on developing techniques that allow researchers to make reasonable real-world conclusions in real-world settings, where classical assumptions do not hold exactly.

Linear regression
Main article: Linear regression
See simple linear regression for a derivation of these formulas and a numerical example
In linear regression, the model specification is that the dependent variable, 
�
�
{\displaystyle y_{i}} is a linear combination of the parameters (but need not be linear in the independent variables). For example, in simple linear regression for modeling 
�
{\displaystyle n} data points there is one independent variable: 
�
�
{\displaystyle x_{i}}, and two parameters, 
�
0
{\displaystyle \beta _{0}} and 
�
1
{\displaystyle \beta _{1}}:

straight line: 
�
�
=
�
0
+
�
1
�
�
+
�
�
,
�
=
1
,
…
,
�
.
{\displaystyle y_{i}=\beta _{0}+\beta _{1}x_{i}+\varepsilon _{i},\quad i=1,\dots ,n.\!}
In multiple linear regression, there are several independent variables or functions of independent variables.

Adding a term in 
�
�
2
{\displaystyle x_{i}^{2}} to the preceding regression gives:

parabola: 
�
�
=
�
0
+
�
1
�
�
+
�
2
�
�
2
+
�
�
,
 
�
=
1
,
…
,
�
.
{\displaystyle y_{i}=\beta _{0}+\beta _{1}x_{i}+\beta _{2}x_{i}^{2}+\varepsilon _{i},\ i=1,\dots ,n.\!}
This is still linear regression; although the expression on the right hand side is quadratic in the independent variable 
�
�
{\displaystyle x_{i}}, it is linear in the parameters 
�
0
{\displaystyle \beta _{0}}, 
�
1
{\displaystyle \beta _{1}} and 
�
2
.
{\displaystyle \beta _{2}.}

In both cases, 
�
�
{\displaystyle \varepsilon _{i}} is an error term and the subscript 
�
{\displaystyle i} indexes a particular observation.

Returning our attention to the straight line case: Given a random sample from the population, we estimate the population parameters and obtain the sample linear regression model:

�
^
�
=
�
^
0
+
�
^
1
�
�
.
{\displaystyle {\widehat {y}}_{i}={\widehat {\beta }}_{0}+{\widehat {\beta }}_{1}x_{i}.}
The residual, 
�
�
=
�
�
−
�
^
�
{\displaystyle e_{i}=y_{i}-{\widehat {y}}_{i}}, is the difference between the value of the dependent variable predicted by the model, 
�
^
�
{\displaystyle {\widehat {y}}_{i}}, and the true value of the dependent variable, 
�
�
{\displaystyle y_{i}}. One method of estimation is ordinary least squares. This method obtains parameter estimates that minimize the sum of squared residuals, SSR:

�
�
�
=
∑
�
=
1
�
�
�
2
{\displaystyle SSR=\sum _{i=1}^{n}e_{i}^{2}}
Minimization of this function results in a set of normal equations, a set of simultaneous linear equations in the parameters, which are solved to yield the parameter estimators, 
�
^
0
,
�
^
1
{\displaystyle {\widehat {\beta }}_{0},{\widehat {\beta }}_{1}}.

Under the further assumption that the population error term is normally distributed, the researcher can use these estimated standard errors to create confidence intervals and conduct hypothesis tests about the population parameters.

Diagnostics
Main article: Regression diagnostics
See also: Category:Regression diagnostics
Once a regression model has been constructed, it may be important to confirm the goodness of fit of the model and the statistical significance of the estimated parameters. Commonly used checks of goodness of fit include the R-squared, analyses of the pattern of residuals and hypothesis testing. Statistical significance can be checked by an F-test of the overall fit, followed by t-tests of individual parameters.

Interpretations of these diagnostic tests rest heavily on the model's assumptions. Although examination of the residuals can be used to invalidate a model, the results of a t-test or F-test are sometimes more difficult to interpret if the model's assumptions are violated. For example, if the error term does not have a normal distribution, in small samples the estimated parameters will not follow normal distributions and complicate inference. With relatively large samples, however, a central limit theorem can be invoked such that hypothesis testing may proceed using asymptotic approximations.

Limited dependent variables
Limited dependent variables, which are response variables that are categorical variables or are variables constrained to fall only in a certain range, often arise in econometrics.

The response variable may be non-continuous ("limited" to lie on some subset of the real line). For binary (zero or one) variables, if analysis proceeds with least-squares linear regression, the model is called the linear probability model. Nonlinear models for binary dependent variables include the probit and logit model. The multivariate probit model is a standard method of estimating a joint relationship between several binary dependent variables and some independent variables. For categorical variables with more than two values there is the multinomial logit. For ordinal variables with more than two values, there are the ordered logit and ordered probit models. Censored regression models may be used when the dependent variable is only sometimes observed, and Heckman correction type models may be used when the sample is not randomly selected from the population of interest. An alternative to such procedures is linear regression based on polychoric correlation (or polyserial correlations) between the categorical variables. Such procedures differ in the assumptions made about the distribution of the variables in the population. If the variable is positive with low values and represents the repetition of the occurrence of an event, then count models like the Poisson regression or the negative binomial model may be used.

Nonlinear regression
Main article: Nonlinear regression
When the model function is not linear in the parameters, the sum of squares must be minimized by an iterative procedure. This introduces many complications which are summarized in Differences between linear and non-linear least squares.

Prediction (interpolation and extrapolation) 
Further information: Predicted response and Prediction interval

In the middle, the interpolated straight line represents the best balance between the points above and below this line. The dotted lines represent the two extreme lines. The first curves represent the estimated values. The outer curves represent a prediction for a new measurement.[20]
Regression models predict a value of the Y variable given known values of the X variables. Prediction within the range of values in the dataset used for model-fitting is known informally as interpolation. Prediction outside this range of the data is known as extrapolation. Performing extrapolation relies strongly on the regression assumptions. The further the extrapolation goes outside the data, the more room there is for the model to fail due to differences between the assumptions and the sample data or the true values.

A prediction interval that represents the uncertainty may accompany the point prediction. Such intervals tend to expand rapidly as the values of the independent variable(s) moved outside the range covered by the observed data.

For such reasons and others, some tend to say that it might be unwise to undertake extrapolation.[21]

However, this does not cover the full set of modeling errors that may be made: in particular, the assumption of a particular form for the relation between Y and X. A properly conducted regression analysis will include an assessment of how well the assumed form is matched by the observed data, but it can only do so within the range of values of the independent variables actually available. This means that any extrapolation is particularly reliant on the assumptions being made about the structural form of the regression relationship. If this knowledge includes the fact that the dependent variable cannot go outside a certain range of values, this can be made use of in selecting the model – even if the observed dataset has no values particularly near such bounds. The implications of this step of choosing an appropriate functional form for the regression can be great when extrapolation is considered. At a minimum, it can ensure that any extrapolation arising from a fitted model is "realistic" (or in accord with what is known).

Power and sample size calculations
There are no generally agreed methods for relating the number of observations versus the number of independent variables in the model. One method conjectured by Good and Hardin is 
�
=
�
�
{\displaystyle N=m^{n}}, where 
�
{\displaystyle N} is the sample size, 
�
{\displaystyle n} is the number of independent variables and 
�
{\displaystyle m} is the number of observations needed to reach the desired precision if the model had only one independent variable.[22] For example, a researcher is building a linear regression model using a dataset that contains 1000 patients (
�
{\displaystyle N}). If the researcher decides that five observations are needed to precisely define a straight line (
�
{\displaystyle m}), then the maximum number of independent variables the model can support is 4, because
