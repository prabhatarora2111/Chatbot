      "\n",
      "a further criticism is that a focus on the situation of women in non-western countries, while often ignoring the issues that exist in the west, is a form of imperialism and of reinforcing western moral superiority; and a way of \"othering\" of domestic violence, by presenting it as something specific to outsiders – the \"violent others\" – and not to the allegedly progressive western cultures.[40] these critics point out that women in western countries often face similar problems, such as domestic violence and rape, as in other parts of the world.[41] they also cite the fact that women faced de jure legal discrimination until just a few decades ago; for instance, in some western countries such as switzerland, greece, spain, and france, women obtained equal rights in family law in the 1980s.[vii][viii][ix][x] another criticism is that there is a selective public discourse with regard to different types of oppression of women, with some forms of violence such as honor killings (most common in certain geographic regions such as parts of asia and north africa) being frequently the object of public debate, while other forms of violence, such as the lenient punishment for crimes of passion across latin america, do not receive the same attention in the west.[43][xi] it is also argued that the criticism of particular laws of many developing countries ignores the influence of colonialism on those legal systems.[xii] there has been controversy surrounding the concepts of westernization and europeanisation, due to their reminder of past colonialism,[44] and also due to the fact that some western countries, such as switzerland, have been themselves been very slow to give women legal rights.[45][46] there have also been objections to the way western media presents women from various cultures creating stereotypes, such as that of 'submissive' asian or eastern european women, a stereotype closely connected to the mail order brides industry.[47] such stereotypes are often blatantly untrue: for instance women in many eastern european countries occupy a high professional status.[48][49] feminists in many developing countries have been strongly opposed to the idea that women in those countries need to be 'saved' by the west.[50] there are questions on how exactly should gender equality be measured, and whether the west is indeed \"best\" at it: a study in 2010 found that among the top 20 countries on female graduates in the science fields at university level most countries were countries that were considered internationally to score very low on the position of women's rights, with the top 3 being iran, saudi arabia and oman, and only 5 european countries made it to that top: romania, bulgaria, italy, georgia and greece.[51]\n",

      "controversy regarding western cultural influence in the world is not new; in the late 1940s, when the universal declaration of human rights was being drafted, the american anthropological association warned that the document would be defining universal rights from a western perspective which could be detrimental to non-western countries, and further argued that the west's history of colonialism and forceful interference with other societies made them a problematic moral representative for universal global standards.[52]\n",
      "\n",
      "there has been criticism that international law, international courts, and universal gender neutral concepts of human rights are at best silent on many of the issues important to women and at worst male centered; considering the male person to be the default.[53] excessive gender neutrality can worsen the situation of women, because the law assumes women are in the same position as men, ignoring the biological fact that in the process of reproduction and pregnancy there is no 'equality', and that apart from physical differences there are socially constructed limitations which assign a socially and culturally inferior position to women – a situation which requires a specific approach to women's rights, not merely a gender neutral one.[54] in a 1975 interview, simone de beauvoir talked about the negative reactions towards women's rights from the left that was supposed to be progressive and support social change, and also expressed skepticism about mainstream international organizations.[55] there have been questions about the acceptability of international intervention into societal domestic issues from international organizations,[56] especially since the multitude of such international bodies can create confusion, including through contradictory rulings on the same issue: for example the ecthr upheld in 2014 france's ban on wearing a burqa in public,[57] while the united nations human rights committee concluded in 2018 that france's ban on burqa in public violates human rights.[58] international bodies have been criticized for being based on an ideology of one size fits all approach to issues, which does not take into account that a specific approach may work in one culture but not in another,[59][60] and that historically international intervention into another country has often done more harm than good; and that ultimately the problems from a culture must be solved from within that culture, not through forceful foreign intervention.[61] a criticism of international organizations is that while they purport to support universal global human rights, they often support the interests of western elites.[62] the legitimacy of international organizations has come into question in the 21st century especially in the light of international scandals, such as child sexual abuse by un peacekeepers.[63]\n",

\"the first to disenthrall woman from the condition of vassalage to which all other religious systems (more or less) consign her, and to secure to her those just and equal rights with man that, by her similarity to him in organization and faculties, both god and nature would seem to demand\".', \"[9] evans and his counterpart, eldress antoinette doolittle, joined women's rights advocates on

order to achieve the above items of \"progress\" in gender equality, with critics arguing that these gender equality strategies are superficial, in that they do not seek to challenge social structures of male domination, and only aim to improve the situation of women within the societal framework of subordination of women to men,[31] and that official public policies (such as state policies or international bodies policies) are questionable, as they are applied in a patriarchal context, and are directly or indirectly controlled by agents of a system which is for the most part male.', '[32] one of the criticisms of the gender equality policies, in particular, those of the european union, is that they disproportionately focus on policies integrating women in public life, but do not seek to genuinely address the deep private sphere oppression.', '[33] a criticism of the western concept and policies of gender equality relates to the degree to which this approach is able to genuinely address in a successful way the problem of violence against women.', '[34][35][36][37][38][39]\\n\\na further criticism is that a focus on the situation of women in non-western countries, while often ignoring the issues that exist in the west, is a form of imperialism and of reinforcing western moral superiority; and a way of \"othering\" of domestic violence, by presenting it as something specific to outsiders – the \"violent others\" – and not to the allegedly progressive western cultures.', '[40] these critics point out that women in western countries often face similar problems, such as domestic violence and rape, as in other parts of the world.', '[41] they also cite the fact that women faced de jure legal discrimination until just a few decades ago; for instance, in some western countries such as switzerland, greece, spain, and france, women obtained equal rights in family law in the 1980s.', '[vii][viii][ix][x] another criticism is that there is a selective public discourse with regard to different types of oppression of women, with some forms of violence such as honor killings (most common in certain geographic regions such as parts of asia and north africa) being frequently the object of public debate, while other forms of violence, such as the lenient punishment for crimes of passion across latin america, do not receive the same attention in the west.', '[43][xi] it is also argued that the criticism of particular laws of many developing countries ignores the influence of colonialism on those legal systems.', '[xii] there has been controversy surrounding the concepts of westernization and europeanisation, due to their reminder of past colonialism,[44] and also due to the fact that some western countries, such as switzerland, have been themselves been very slow to give women legal rights.', \"[45][46] there have also been objections to the way western media presents women from various cultures creating stereotypes, such as that of 'submissive' asian or eastern european women, a stereotype closely connected to the mail order brides industry.\", '[47] such stereotypes are often blatantly untrue: for instance women in many eastern european countries occupy a high professional status.', \"[48][49] feminists in many developing countries have been strongly opposed to the idea that women in those countries need to be 'saved' by the west.\", '[50] there are questions on how exactly should gender equality be measured, and whether the west is indeed \"best\" at it: a study in 2010 found that among the top 20 countries on female graduates in the science fields at university level most countries were countries that were considered internationally to score very low on the position of women\\'s rights, with the top 3 being iran, saudi arabia and oman, and only 5 european countries made it to that top: romania, bulgaria, italy, georgia and greece.', \"[51]\\n\\ncontroversy regarding western cultural influence in the world is not new; in the late 1940s, when the universal declaration of human rights was being drafted, the american anthropological association warned that the document would be defining universal rights from a western perspective which could be detrimental to non-western countries, and further argued that the west's history of colonialism and forceful interference with other societies made them a problematic moral representative for universal global standards.\", '[52]\\n\\nthere has been criticism that international law, international courts, and universal gender neutral concepts of human rights are at best silent on many of the issues important to women and at worst male centered; considering the male person to be the default.', \"[53] excessive gender neutrality can worsen the situation of women, because the law assumes women are in the same position as men, ignoring the biological fact that in the process of reproduction and pregnancy there is no 'equality', and that apart from physical differences there are socially constructed limitations which assign a socially and culturally inferior position to women – a situation which requires a specific approach to women's rights, not merely a gender neutral one.\", \"[54] in a 1975 interview, simone de beauvoir talked about the negative reactions towards women's rights from the left that was supposed to be progressive and support social change, and also expressed skepticism about mainstream international organizations.\", \"[55] there have been questions about the acceptability of international intervention into societal domestic issues from international organizations,[56] especially since the multitude of such international bodies can create confusion, including through contradictory rulings on the same issue: for example the ecthr upheld in 2014 france's ban on wearing a burqa in public,[57] while the united nations human rights committee concluded in 2018 that france's ban on burqa in public violates human rights.\", '[58] international bodies have been criticized for being based on an ideology of one size fits all approach to issues, which does not take into account that a specific approach may work in one culture but not in another,[59][60] and that historically international intervention into another country has often done more harm than good; and that ultimately the problems from a culture must be solved from within that culture, not through forceful foreign intervention.', '[61] a criticism of international organizations is that while they purport to support universal global human rights, they often support the interests of western elites.', '[62] the legitimacy of international organizations has come into question in the 21st century especially in the light of
